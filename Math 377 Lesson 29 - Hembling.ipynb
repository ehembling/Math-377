    "Last lesson, we studied method of moments estimators. These estimators are obtained by setting the moments of a distribution equal to the sample moments obtained from an independent random sample, and then solving for the parameters of interest. As we saw, method of moments estimators are relatively easy to find, but don't always make sense (as in the case of $X\\sim \\textsf{Unif}(0,b)$.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to estimate is by maximizing the likelihood function. First, we should introduce the likelihood function. The likelihood function, $L(\\theta \\mid \\textbf{x})$, is a function of $\\theta$ that is larger for likelier values of $\\theta$. Finding the value of $\\theta$ that maximizes this function yields a maximum likelihood estimator, or $\\hat{\\theta}_{ML}$. \n",

Thus, if $ f(x_i) $= 0 for any value of $x_i$, then the likelihood function equals 0. Thus, if b is less than the largest number in the dataset, the likelihood function will equal 0 because there exists an $x_i$ larger than b and $f(x_i) = 0$. Thus, b must be atleast the max value in the dataset to get a non-zero likelihood. Furthrmore, the likelihood function (assuming all $x_i$'s are less than or equal to b) becomes ${1 \\over b^n}$. Thus, as b becomes larger, the likelihood function decreases in value. Therefore, the minimum b for which the likelihood function is non-zero maximizes it. Hence, b = maximum value in the dataset of x's."
